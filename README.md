## Project Goals
The idea for this project has always been something that I would like to see more when searching for a food recipe. From having a background in food, whenever I try and look for a recipe, most sites just bombard you with recipes in which some are just not relevant. I wanted to make a website that was clean, appealing to the eye and straight forward to what the person was after. In addition to this, I also wanted to add advertising space in the for of an events section.

## Target Audience
The type of people who I am aiming this website at are people who in essence are they lazy type. Instead of them going out looking for a recipe, they would simply come to Food First, see what the weekly recommended recipes are and take it from there. if they dont like what they see then they can click over to the gallery where they are able to see a whole range of dishes.
